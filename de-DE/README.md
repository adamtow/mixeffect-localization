# MixEffect Localization Translation de-DE

## v1.0

### Section Audio
Would suggest not make any changes within Audio-Section since all these terms are also common in the German language. 

### To Review: Possible duplicates in Localizable.strings

0204  "background" = "Background";
0287  "background" = "Background";

0974  "erase-content" = "Erase Content and Settings";
0975  "erase-content" = "Erase Content and Settings";

1186  "start-trial" = "30-Day Trial";
1187  "start-trial" = "Start Trial";

### Revisit to clarify context
0288  "bevel-in-out" = "Bevel In Out";
      "bevel-in"     = "Bevel In";
      "bevel-none"   = "No Bevel";
      "bevel-out"    = "Bevel Out";
