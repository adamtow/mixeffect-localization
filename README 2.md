# MixEffect Localization

Help localize the MixEffect application in your native language. 

Use the files in the **en-US** folder as the source of truth and submit a pull request to translate MixEffect.

NOTE: The strings contained in the **Localizable.strings** and **Plurals.stringdict** files are used in the main application. The strings used in MixEffect shortcut actions will become available for localization at a later date.
